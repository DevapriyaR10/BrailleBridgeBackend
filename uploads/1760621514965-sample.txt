I prefer working in a team because I believe collaboration leads to better outcomes than working alone. In a team, diverse perspectives and complementary skills allow us to solve problems more efficiently, innovate creatively, and maintain high-quality results. I enjoy sharing knowledge, learning from others, and contributing to a collective goal. 

For example, in my Rently  project, I led a team of four, coordinating tasks and encouraging open communication. This approach not only ensured smooth progress but also fostered trust and continuous improvement, as each member could contribute ideas and refine solutions collectively.

Working in a team also motivates me to grow personally and professionally, as I can learn from senior colleagues and peers while supporting them in return. I am confident that by collaborating closely with YRL’s team, I can contribute to building high-quality software products while fostering a positive, cooperative work environment.
